Cache Analysis:
In this project we build a cache simulator, become familiar with the working of the cache, and evaluate its performance. Furthermore, we studied  the different cache management policies and organization. We also discuss in detail on the cache miss, the real reason behind cache misses, impact of cache block size, associativity, memory bandwidth.Second, we came across the concept of Memoization, which treaded into value prediction, and effective memory management policies. Probing to incorporate these into the cache simulator is our initial priority. Furthermore, trying to reduce the cache miss rate based on our study is the final goal.Third, we also had a few elementary ideas on ‘ on -chip memory’ and how it would effectively, reduce cache miss rate. Our futuristic goal is that this would one day bring about a generation of intelligent processors.
